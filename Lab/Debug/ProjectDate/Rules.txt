Lab 2.1.4 Some actual evaluations - finding day of week
Objectives
Familiarize the student with:
building complex sequence of elementary operations,
choosing types and operations adequate to problem,
careful code testing.
Scenario
Have you ever wondered how to find a weekday for any (past or future) date? OK, you can check it in a calendar (you probably have
one in your smartphone), but this is not a solution for a coder. We will do it in a harder and more exciting way - we will write a program
for it (could you ever suspect that we are going to offer you something else?)
One of the most popular algorithms for such a task is the so-called "Zeller-Keith's congruency". Sounds complicated? Nothing could be
further from the truth and we are going to show you that. You will need three values:
year number (int - let's assume that we are interested only in dates from 20th and 21th centuries)
month number (int - 1 to 12)
day number (int - 1 to 
it depends
)
Be patient - it will take a while:
1
. 
decrease month number by 2
2
. 
if month number became less than zero, increment it by 12 and decrement year by 1
3
. 
take month number, multiply it by 83 and divide by 32
4
. 
add day number to month
5
. 
add year number to month
6
. 
add year/4 to month
7
. 
subtract year/100 from month
8
. 
add year/400 to month
9
. 
find a remainder of dividing month by 7
10
. 
Congrats! A week day number is ready for you! 0 - Sunday, 1 - Monday, ... and so on.
We want you to write a code which finds a weekday number for a date entered by a user. The program should ask the user for year,
month and day (in this order) and output a value indicating a week day.
Make your code as smart as possible.
Test your code using data provided by us.
